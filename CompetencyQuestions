We designed a set of competency questions to ensure that the ontology covers all the concepts needed to describe a behaviour in the context of how it is measured and how it relates to another behaviour. These questions are designed to represent the sort of questions that behavioural scientists will be interested in when they compare behaviours that were measured in different studies. We present the competency questions in the following table and the sort of responses we expect. We also present the SPARQL queries we designed to represent the competency questions and the results we obtained by running the queries. 

As an example dataset for this evaluation, we extracted data from Ha & Kwon (2016) were they studied the relationship between past recycling behaviour and shopping for green apparel. We added the data elements and mapped them to their corresponding classes in TURBBO.
