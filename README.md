# TURBBO
This is the project repository for "Tools for understanding relationships between behaviours using ontology" project. 

The complete TURBBO owl file is contained in turbbo.owl (this requires downloading all imported files) or turbbo-merged.owl (self contained).

TURBBO consists of three levels, which can be donwloaded and used as separate ontologies:
1. The turbbo_upper_level.owl
2. the MiddleOntology.owl
3. The behaviour_properties.owl

This repository also contains the SPARQL queries and answers used for evaluation of the ontology (see evaluation.txt)
