# TURBBO
This is the project repository for "Tools for understanding relationships between behaviours using ontology" project. 

We present an ontology of behaviour, which provides a structural model for describing behaviours and formalises characteristics and correlations between the behaviours.

This is the latest version of the TURBBO ontologies which consists of three levels and can be donwloaded and used as separate ontologies:
1. The upper.owl
2. the behaviours.owl
3. The behaviour_properties.owl

There is a merged version of the TURBBO ontologies which is turbbo.owl. 

This repository also contains the SPARQL queries and answers used for evaluation of the ontology see [CompetencyQuestions](https://github.com/fatibaba/turbbo/blob/main/CompetencyQuestions.md). [turbbo-dataset.ttl](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fatibaba/turbbo/main/turbbo-dataset.ttl) contains the dataset for testing the queries.
